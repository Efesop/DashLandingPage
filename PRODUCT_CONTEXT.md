## Frequently Asked Questions (Order by Priority)

### 1. How is Dash different from other notes apps?
Dash is the only notes app that keeps everything 100% on your device. No cloud servers, no data collection, no corporate surveillance. Your notes are encrypted and completely private.

### 2. How much is Dash?
Dash is a one-time purchase of $14.99 with no subscriptions or hidden costs. You get lifetime access, free updates, and priority support.

### 3. What platforms does Dash work on?
Dash works best on **Mac** (native app with auto-updates). We also have a **Web version (PWA)** that works on any browser, including iOS and Android devices. Mac is recommended for the best experience.

### 4. How secure is the encryption?
Dash uses AES-256-GCM encryption, the same standard used by banks and governments. Your notes are encrypted locally on your device with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation (200,000 iterations) before being saved, ensuring complete privacy.

### 5. What happens if I lose my device?
Since your notes are stored locally, losing your device means losing your notes. We recommend regularly exporting your notes as encrypted backups (.dashpack files) to external storage for safekeeping.

### 6. Can I sync between devices?
Dash doesn't offer cloud sync to maintain your privacy. However, you can export your notes as encrypted files (.dashpack) and import them on other devices manually. This keeps your data under your control.

### 7. Why don't you offer cloud storage?
Cloud storage requires sending your data to external servers, which compromises privacy. Dash's core principle is keeping your data exclusively on your device where you have complete control.

### 8. Is Dash open source? (Lower priority - don't overemphasize)
Yes, Dash is open source. The full source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Efesop/rich-text-editor) for anyone to audit. We sell Dash for convenience, support, and automatic updates, but you can build it yourself if you prefer.

### 9. Can I try Dash before buying?
Yes! You can use the [Web version (PWA)](https://efesop.github.io/rich-text-editor/) for free to try Dash. For the best experience with automatic updates and native performance, we recommend the Mac app ($14.99 one-time).

### 10. What if I need to download Dash again?
If you've already purchased Dash, you can [recover your download link](https://dashnote.io/payment/recovery) at any time. Your purchase includes lifetime access.
